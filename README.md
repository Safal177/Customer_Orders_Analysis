# Python Machine Learning Project: analyzing customer spending patterns with sales categories

Python was used to analyze internet sales ordered by customers. This project classifies customers, finds revenue through category, and goes on insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

# Outline:
This project shows how Python’s data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets) are used 
 into e-commerce sales data for:
•	Customer classification (high, moderate, low value buyers)
•	Revenue analysis according to product category
•	Finding cross-category purchase trends
•	Extracting top customers as well as products

# Tools applied: 
•	Python 3
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	 Library: “collections”

#  Dataset:
•	Sample dataset of customer orders (for educating purposes, synthetic data used).
•	 Each record shows: customer name, product, price, and category.
